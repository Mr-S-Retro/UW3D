New Project from a New Team!


Heya fellas, have you ever played Wolfenstein 3D, and thought to yourself "Ugh, I wish there was a new way to experience this game and get psyched like never before!"?
Well, fear no more buck'o, cuz' an experience like that will come soon!

Introducing "Wolfenstein 3D - The Ultimate Edition", made by the RMT (Retronis Modding Team)!
This Doom mod promises to be the best Wolfenstein that Wolfenstein can be! It adds things such as remade maps in the Boom format, new enemies thanks to the magic of DeHackEd, enhanced music, new weapons, and a whole lot more!

But, "new" and "enhanced" are not specific at all, are they? We know that, and that's why we have included a list with changes right below!

- The Fist has been replaced by the Knife.
- The Chainsaw has been replaced by the Spear of Destiny (yes, you finally get to use it!).
- The Pistol is, well, still a Pistol, but with the Wolf3D style. Same goes for the Shotgun and Super Shotgun.
- The Chaingun has been replaced with an MP40, with the same fire rate. Where's the Chaingun, then?
- Well, the Rocket Launcher has been replaced by the Chaingun, now TWICE as fast!
- A Rocket Launcher-like weapon, however, is still included! The Plasma Rifle has been replaced by the Napalm Launcher.
- Last, but definitely not least: the BFG has been replaced by the Flamethrower. Yes, you've heard us right: a FLAMETHROWER!

The way we're gonna release this baby is to first release Episode 1 as our Shareware episode. Then, if you enjoyed the regular campaign, you can get the other 5 Episodes from Wolfenstein's campaign! And then, if you really, REALLY liked those episodes, you can get the extra 21 Levels from Spear of Destiny! Oh boy, does that sound like a deal to me!

But wait, THERE'S MORE! You can join the RMT to contribute to this project and more to come from Retronis! All you need to do, is to pay a visit to our Discord server, and apply!

We hope you look forward to this project just as we do, stay tuned, and get ready to get psyched!
